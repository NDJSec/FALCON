A hard drive can be compared to a small computer. It uses
microprocessors to control both the physical behavior of the various
electro-mechanical components. The logical operations that store and
retrieve data as an arrangement of the magnetic particles on the disk
surface. This operation is completely independent of the operation of
the host PC. Like any computer, the hard drive needs its own software to
control the operation of the microprocessors, but unlike a PC this
software is limited to the drive’s operational functionality, and is not
(and under normal circumstances cannot be) changed by the user. This
hard drive ‘software’ is, as a result, more usually referred to as
**Firmware**. The firmware carries out a range of functions, from what
might be termed ‘Analogue’ functions such as controlling the spinning of
the disc and positioning of the read/write heads, as well as the
‘Digital’ functions used to pass data files to and from the PC, keeping
track of the location and parameters of the data files stored, and many,
many more.

## Corrupted Firmware

Without firmware, or the firmware is corrupted the drive is simply a
collection of electronic components.
