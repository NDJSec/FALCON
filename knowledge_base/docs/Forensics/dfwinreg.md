dfWinReg, or Digital Forensics Windows Registry, provides read-only
access to Windows Registry objects. The goal of dfWinReg is to provide a
generic interface for accessing Windows Registry objects that resembles
the Registry key hierarchy as seen on a live Windows system.

## History

dfWinReg originates from the Plaso project and is also based on ideas
from the winreg-kb project. It was largely rewritten and made into a
stand-alone project to provide more flexibility and allow other projects
to make use of Windows Registry functionality.
