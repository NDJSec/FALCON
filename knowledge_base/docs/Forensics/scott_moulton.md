[Scott Moulton](scott_moulton.md) was the first person arrested
for Port Scanning in January of 2000. During the defence, Scott found he
had to train his lawyers on the technical aspects of computers in order
to defend himself. This began his forensic computer career with a
speciality in rebuilding hard drives for investigation purposes.

Many times working on a case, Mr. Moulton will be given hard drives that
had already failed in an effort to “blame” the opposition or to slow
down the work and cost the opposing forces more money. To combat the
“blame” scenario, Mr. Moulton developed a skill at rebuilding hard
drives and recovering data. In the five years since its inception, Mr.
Moulton has handled many complex cases that include homicide,
embezzlement, theft, divorce, child pornography and corporate fraud and
continues to combat dead hard drives to this day.
