## Belkasoft T

**Belkasoft Triage** is a new digital forensic and incident response
tool developed specifically for a quick analysis of a live computer and
making a partial image of important data.

**Belkasoft T** is designed to assist in situations when an investigator
or a first responder is at the scene of incident and needs to quickly
identify and obtain specific digital evidence stored on a Windows
machine.

The product is irreplaceable in situations of time pressure, when there
is a need to quickly detect presence of specific data and obtain
investigative leads instead of conducting an in-depth analysis of all
the digital evidence.

#### Key features

- Launch Belkasoft Triage from a dongle connected to a device being
  investigated
- Detect 1500+ types of computer, mobile and cloud artifacts such as
  emails, chats, browsers, system settings and others
- Automatically acquire a computer RAM dump
- Detect presence of virtual machines, memory files and mobile backups
- Detect skin tone in found pictures
- Calculate file hash values and show an immediate alert on files with
  known hashes
- Stop the analysis at any time once you got enough information
- Export discovered results partially or entirely
- Select evidence to be included into the resulting image
- Use the same dongle to store the image
