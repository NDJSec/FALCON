The concept of a Sealed Digital Evidence Bag describes the idea that
digital evidence data and possibly its meta-data should be sealed in
order to safeguard the integrity of the digital forensic process. In the
narrow sense as defined by Schatz and Clark, the concept describes a way
of formatting and signing forensic data, its meta-data and providence
information in some kind of a digital forensic data storage file format.
This narrow definition is useful mostly for the transport of forensic
evidence between different parties, locations or practitioners by means
of exchange of **signed** storage formats.

In a broader interpretation the same idea of sealed forensic data, its
meta-data and providence information can be used not between people ,
organisations and legal entities, but between different forensic and
non-forensic evidence data processing tools by means of access control
and privilege separation techniques. This second approach to Sealed
Digital Evidence Bags is used by [MattockFS](mattockfs.md).
