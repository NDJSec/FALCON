The **Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer** is a free volatile memory
acquisition tool developed by [Belkasoft](belkasoft.md). It
allows to reliably extract the entire contents of computer’s volatile
memory – even if protected by an active anti-debugging or anti-dumping
system. Separate 32-bit and 64-bit builds are available in order to
minimize the tool’s footprint as much as possible. Memory dumps captured
with Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer can be analyzed with Live RAM Analysis
in [Belkasoft Evidence Center](belkasoft_evidence_center.md) or
any other similar product.

## Bypassing Anti-Debugging and Anti-Dumping Protection

Acquiring volatile memory from a computer running a debugging protection
or anti-dumping system is tricky. Most memory acquisition tools run in
the system’s user mode, and are unable to bypass the defense of such
protection system (which run in the systems’ most privileged kernel
mode).

Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer is designed to work correctly even if an
aggressive anti-debugging or anti-memory dumping system is running. By
operating in kernel mode, Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer plays on the same
level with these protection systems, being able to correctly acquire
address space of applications protected with the most sophisticated
systems such as nProtect GameGuard.

## Compatibility and System Requirements

Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer is compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit
editions of Windows including XP, Vista, Windows 7/8/10, 2003 and 2008
Server. The tool does not require installation, and can be launched from
a USB thumb drive.
