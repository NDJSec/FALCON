File footer is a data structure at or very near the end of the file.

Some file formats have well-defined footers, easily identified by
signatures or other methods. Other file formats do not have any
identifiable footers, but just have their data end.

File footers are useful in [file carving](file_carving.md),
where they are used to identify the end of file, and in validation
during or after data recovery.
