Removable User Identity Module (R-UIM) is a card developed for CDMA
handsets that extends the GSM SIM card to CDMA phones and networks. To
work in CDMA networks, the R-UIM contains an early version of the CSIM
application. The card also contains SIM (GSM) application, so it can
work on both networks. It is physically compatible with GSM SIMs and can
fit into existing GSM phones as it is an extension of the GSM 11.11
standard.

The card brings one of the main advantages of GSM to CDMA network
phones. By having a removable identity card, CDMA users can change
phones while keeping their phone numbers by simply swapping the cards.
This simplifies many situations such as phone upgrades, phone
replacements due to damage, or using the same phone on a different
provider's CDMA network.

This form of card is widely used in China under the CDMA service of
China Unicom(The CDMA service of China Unicom was acquired by China
Telecom in 2008) . However, it is also used elsewhere such as India,
Thailand, and Japan.
