The Message id consists of five parts:

    period. The value is dislayed in decimal and is the number of
    seconds since midnight on 1 Jan 1970. In the example above,
    1185616355 refers to Sat, 28 Jul 2007 09:52:35 GMT.
2.  The process id number in decimal followed by a period
3.  The third value starts at zero but may increase as more messages are
    sent. It is also followed by a period
4.  The word `camel` followed by an '@'
5.  If the canonical hostname can found, it is used. Otherwise the
    hostname

The Message id format comes from the function
`camel_header_msgid_generate` in
`evolution-data-server/camel/camel-mime-utils.c`.
