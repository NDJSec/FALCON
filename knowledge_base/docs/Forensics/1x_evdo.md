1X EVDO stands for EVolution Data Optimized, a wireless broadband data
standard used in many CDMA providers around the world. QualComm had the
initial design in 1999 to meet IMT-2000 (International Mobile
Telecommunications-2000) standards being better than 2Mbit/s downlink
for stationary communications.

Verizon currently implements 1X EVDO called V Cast for high speed data
speeds for mobile phones. Verizon and Sprint both provide this service
in most major U.S. cities. EVDO is based the 1xRTT standard technology
that provides two to three times internet speed of dial-up. Since it is
based on 1xRTT, if an user goes outside of the EVDO coverage zone, the
user automatically is transferred to 1xRTT standard making internet
access very convenient.

The advantages Evdo has over WiFi is that it has seamless roaming,
customers can access corporate VPN anywhere they can get a signal,
realtime downloads, and signal travel on cell phone cell sites.
