Although the **techniques** for investigating [computer
forensics](computer_forensics.md) are limited only by an
[investigator](investigator.md)'s imagination, here are some
guidelines on tried and true methodologies.

## Techniques

- [Data Reduction](data_reduction.md) - By eliminating
  information that doesn't matter, an investigator is left with
  information that does matter.
- [Locard's exchange principle](locard's_exchange_principle.md)

## Guidelines

- RFC 3227, "Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving," D.
  Brezinski and T. Killalea, February 2002.
